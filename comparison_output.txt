Comparing : union brain tumor -vs- total human GEM 2022 

number of edges containing lactate or glutamate transporters
in total human GEM : 313
in union brain tumor: 256

important! : as compartment nomenclature is different (it changed in 2022)
       just use metabolites without their compartment

Differences among versions, this time with suppressed compartment:

 ->  present in human-gem, but not in union-brain-tumor:
{('URAD', '5-Hydroxy-2-oxo-4-ureido-2,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate')}
 ->  present in union-brain-tumor, but not in human-gem:
{('ALDH9A1', '4-aminobutyrate')}

in conclusion, differences are negligible after suppressing the compartments
